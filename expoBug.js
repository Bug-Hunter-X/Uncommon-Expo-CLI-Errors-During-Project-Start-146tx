This error typically occurs when using Expo's `start` command to run your React Native application and is often linked to problems with your project's setup, dependencies, or the Expo CLI itself.  The root cause isn't always immediately obvious and can require systematic debugging.  One frequent culprit is inconsistencies between your project's configuration (e.g., `package.json`, `app.json`, `eas.json`) and the Expo CLI's expectations.  Another possibility is conflicts or issues with the Node.js version or npm/yarn package managers.
