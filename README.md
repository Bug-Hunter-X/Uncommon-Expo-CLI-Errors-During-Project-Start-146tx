# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors During Project Start

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when starting an Expo project using the Expo CLI.  The error's manifestation varies, but generally involves unexpected behavior or failure during the `expo start` process.  The root cause is often subtle and can involve inconsistencies in project configuration, dependencies, or the Expo CLI environment itself.  This example focuses on a scenario where the issue stems from mismatched or corrupted dependencies.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to run the project using `expo start`.  Observe the error messages.

## Solution

The solution often involves a thorough review of project dependencies and configurations.  The following steps are recommended:

* **Check `package.json`:** Verify all dependencies are correctly specified and compatible.
* **Clean and reinstall:**  Delete the `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to rebuild the dependency tree.
* **Verify Node.js and npm/yarn:** Ensure you are using a compatible Node.js version and have the latest npm or yarn installed.
* **Expo CLI update:** Update the Expo CLI using `expo upgrade`. 
* **Inspect error messages:** Carefully examine the error logs for clues to the underlying problem.  These messages may point to a specific dependency conflict or configuration flaw.
* **Examine `app.json` and `eas.json`:** Verify that these configuration files are properly structured and that all settings are accurate.

This repository offers a demonstration of the problem and a potential solution.  However, uncommon errors often demand a case-by-case approach that necessitates careful analysis of specific error messages and project contexts.
