The solution to this type of Expo CLI error often involves systematically checking for inconsistencies and resolving dependencies.  Here's a refined approach:

1. **Clean the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder, and remove the `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) file if it exists.
2. **Reinstall dependencies:** Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to refresh the dependencies.  Consider adding the `--force` flag (use with caution!) for `npm install --force` if other issues persist. 
3. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** Examine your `package.json` for conflicting or incompatible packages. The `npm ls` command can help visualize the dependency tree to identify conflicts.  If conflicts exist, resolve them by updating, downgrading, or removing the conflicting packages.
4. **Verify Expo CLI version:**  Run `expo --version` to ensure you are using the most up-to-date Expo CLI.  Update if necessary using `expo upgrade`.
5. **Review `app.json` and `eas.json`:**  These files hold project configurations. Carefully check for any typos or inconsistencies.
6. **Node.js version:** Ensure you're using a supported Node.js LTS (long-term support) version recommended for Expo.
7. **Restart your system:**  A simple restart can sometimes resolve temporary system issues affecting the CLI.
8. **Create a new project:**  If all else fails, consider creating a fresh Expo project to rule out issues with the current project's structure or files.
